# Fantastic Food Finder

An app to allow the user to find nearby restaurants, and a gallery that displays the current top 10 restaurants that are trending, listed as cheap eats and good for a loved up couple.

## Contents

<p>
The app is composed of an html page, javascript file and a css file. It makes use of the Google Maps API for the functionality to find nearby restaurants and the Zomato API for the list of restaurants that are trending, cheap eats and suitable for date nights.
</p>

## User Story

<p>
We were tasked with creating an app of our choice that must use at least 2 APIs. We viewed a suitable list of APIS to use at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#index and decided on a restaurant finding app.
After inspecting the functionality of the APIs it was decided to use the user's current location along with a distance parameter provided by the user to implement the search, with the results to be displayed in a list on the left hand side of a Goolge map.
Initially the intention was to use the Zomato API to display the menu of a selected restaurant, however it proved difficult to match results between APIs. It was then decided for further functionality the Zomato API could be used to display a gallery of a number of different categories of resturants.
